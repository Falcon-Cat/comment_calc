# comment_calc
Find Data from YouTube API to understand comment interaction by user and video. 
Should be able to calculate number of viewers vs. number of viewers who comment on videos.

The purpose of this program is for YouTubers to be able to calculate their number of ENGAGED viewers. A
viewer that comments is definitely engaged. This will help youtubers sell their adspace in-video more effectively
because this is a more effective statistic to measure ad potential than mere average views.

GOALS:
1) Calculate the ratio of viewers:viewers that have commented on the video
2) Extrapolate this outwards to create viewers that comment on channel
3) Data extraction of return viewers:return commentors
4) Number of routine Commentors

PLAN:

Goal 1:
Google api to find analytic data.
Set program to look at one video and one video's viewers.
Program crosslist all viewers with viewers that have commented.
Return Ratio.

Goal 2:
Set this to run and store on all videos of a youtuber, to somehow find trends in data
over time. More upgrades to come.

Things I need to use/learn.
1) YouTube api for video metrics.
2) Javascript
3) Perhapse a public web interface, I'm not tryna sell this lol
